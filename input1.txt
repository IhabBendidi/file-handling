D1	this is the first of five documents
D2	Each of the documents will be on a single line. the document title is separated by a TAB character
D3	Why? well, just a space would be confusing with the rest of the whitespace in the documents. Tabs are easier.
D4	You do need to look out for carriage returns though. some languages allow for "line" as an entity
D5	Other languages will insist on a block of text delineated by carriage return statements!!!
